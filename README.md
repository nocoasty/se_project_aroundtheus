### Content Brief via Figma

Unlike prior projects and sprints, there were no instructions outside of a brief in Figma. Utilizing text properties, color properties, element and object dimensions, and margins I constructed this responsive website.<br><br>

Buttons have been given hover and active properties to make the entire site feel more interactive and responsive. I have also included `aria-label` tags for each button to make the page more accessible.

I took a stylistic executive decision to add `::hover` and `::active` properties to the interactive elements.
